      "10.2 Tangent to a Circle\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point .\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P\n to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q 1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, you\ncan observe that in all other positions of AB, it will\nintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R",
      "1\nor R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle .\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P . Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position A B of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide .\nFig. 10.3 (i)\nFig. 10.2\n*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\nReprint 2025-26",

In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point \nA which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle.\nCIRCLES\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 145\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used\nin taking out water from the well.

      "148 MATHEMA TICS\nActivity 3 :  Draw a circle on a paper. T ake a\npoint P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the\ncircle through this point? You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle in\ntwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it\n[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw\ntangents through this point. You have already\nobserved that there is only one tangent to the\ncircle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and\ntry to draw tangents to the circle from this point.\nWhat do you observe? You will find that you\ncan draw exactly two tangents to the circle\nthrough this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing\nthrough a point lying inside the circle.\nCase 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a\ncircle passing through a point lying on the circle.\nCase 3 :  There are exactly two tangents to a\ncircle through a point lying outside the circle.\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), T\n1and T2 are the points of\ncontact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2\nrespectively.\nThe length of the segment of the tangent\nfrom the external point P and the point of contact\nwith the circle is called the length of the tangent\nfrom the point P to the circle.\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to\nthe circle. The lengths PT 1 and PT 2 have a common property. Can you find this?\nMeasure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof\nof this fact in the following theorem.\n(i)\n(ii)\nFig. 10.6\n(iii)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 149\nTheorem 10.2 :  The lengths of tangents drawn\nfrom an external point to a cir cle are equal .\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O, a\npoint P lying outside the circle and two tangents\nPQ, PR on the circle from P  (see Fig. 10.7). We\nare required to prove that PQ = PR.\nFor this, we join OP , OQ and OR. Then\n∠  OQP and ∠  ORP are right angles, because\nthese are angles between the radii and tangents,\nand according to Theorem 10.1 they are right\nangles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\nOQ = OR (Radii of the same circle)\nOP = OP (Common)\nTherefore, ∆  OQP ≅ ∆  ORP (RHS)\nThis gives PQ = PR (CPCT)\nRemarks\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\nPQ2 = OP 2 – OQ 2 = OP 2 – OR 2 = PR 2 (As OQ = OR)\nwhich gives PQ = PR.\n2. Note also that ∠  OPQ = ∠  OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠  QPR,\ni.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.\nLet us take some examples.\nExample 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,\nthe chord of the larger circle, which touches the\nsmaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.\nSolution : We are given two concentric circles\nC1 and C 2 with centre O and a chord AB of the\nlarger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle\nC2 at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove\nthat AP = BP.\nLet us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C 2 at P\nand OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,\nOP ⊥ AB\nFig. 10.7\nFig. 10.8\nReprint 2025-26"
