Finally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe?

Draw a circle and two lines parallel to a given line such that one is a tangent and the other, a secant to the circle. 10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the following activity: Fig. 10.5 Reprint 2025-26  148 MATHEMA TICS Activity 3 :  Draw a circle on a paper. T ake a point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)]. Next take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)]. Finally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)]. We can summarise these facts as follows: Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle. Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle. Case 3 :  There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle. In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T 1and T2 are the points of contact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2 respectively. The length of the segment of the tangent from the external point P and the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent from the point P to the circle. Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to the circle. The lengths PT 1 and PT 2 have a common property. Can you find this?...\n",

T ake a point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)]. Next take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)]. Finally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)]. We can summarise these facts as follows: Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle. Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle. Case 3 :  There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle. In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T 1and T2 are the points of contact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2 respectively.

      "Have you seen a bicycle or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position of the wheel with respect to its movement on the ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere? (See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel. Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through the point of contact with the ground appears to be at right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4).
