To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P\n to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)]. In various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q 1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB).

To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P\n to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)]. In various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q 1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, you\ncan observe that in all other positions of AB, it will\nintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R\n1\nor R2 or R3, etc."

For this, we join OP , OQ and OR. Then\n∠  OQP and ∠  ORP are right angles, because\nthese are angles between the radii and tangents,\nand according to Theorem 10.1 they are right\nangles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\nOQ = OR (Radii of the same circle)\nOP = OP (Common) Therefore, ∆  OQP ≅ ∆  ORP (RHS)\nThis gives PQ = PR (CPCT) Remarks\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows: PQ2 = OP 2 – OQ 2 = OP 2 – OR 2 = PR 2 (As OQ = OR)\nwhich gives PQ = PR.\n2. Note also that ∠  OPQ = ∠  OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠  QPR,\ni.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents. Let us take some examples.

Let's denote the points of tangency as follows:\n- Let \\( P, Q, R, \\) and \\( S \\) be the points of tangency on sides \\( AB, BC, CD, \\) and \\( DA \\) respectively.\n\nAccording to the property of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle, the lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Therefore, we have:\n- \\( AP = AS \\)\n- \\( BP = BQ \\)\n- \\( CR = CQ \\)\n- \\( DR = DS \\)\n\nNow, consider the sum of the lengths of the sides:\n- \\( AB = AP + BP \\)\n- \\( BC = BQ + CQ \\)\n- \\( CD = CR + DR \\)\n- \\( DA = DS + AS \\)\n\nAdding the opposite sides:\n- \\( AB + CD = (AP + BP) + (CR + DR) \\)\n- \\( AD + BC = (DS + AS) + (BQ + CQ) \\)\n\nSubstituting the equal tangents:\n- \\( AB + CD = (AS + BQ) + (CQ + DS) \\)\n- \\( AD + BC = (DS + AS) + (BQ + CQ) \\)\n\nSince both expressions simplify to the same sum, we have:\n\\[ AB + CD = AD + BC \\]\n\nThus, in a quadrilateral ABCD circumscribing a circle, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides is equal.",

      "T ake a\npoint P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the\ncircle through this point? You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle in\ntwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)]. Next take a point P on the circle and draw\ntangents through this point. You have already\nobserved that there is only one tangent to the\ncircle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)]. Finally, take a point P outside the circle and\ntry to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you\ncan draw exactly two tangents to the circle\nthrough this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)]. We can summarise these facts as follows: Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing\nthrough a point lying inside the circle. Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a\ncircle passing through a point lying on the circle. Case 3 :  There are exactly two tangents to a\ncircle through a point lying outside the circle. In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T\n1and T2 are the points of\ncontact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2\nrespectively. The length of the segment of the tangent\nfrom the external point P and the point of contact\nwith the circle is called the length of the tangent\nfrom the point P to the circle.

      "144 MATHEMA TICS\n10\n10.1 Introduction\nYou have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane\nwhich are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have\nalso studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.\nLet us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line\nare given in a plane. So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\nFig. 10.1\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point \nA which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle. CIRCLES\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 145\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used\nin taking out water from the well.

Y\nou\nwill find that after some steps, the length of\nthe chord cut by the lines will gradually\ndecrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of\nthe line and the circle are coming closer and\ncloser [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it\nbecomes zero on one side of the secant and in\nanother case, it becomes zero on the other side\nof the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the\ntangents to the circle parallel to the given secant\nPQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot\nbe more than two tangents parallel to a given\nsecant. This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing\nActivity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the\ncorresponding chord coincide.
